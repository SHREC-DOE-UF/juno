# SST Juno Processor Model

Juno is a very lightweight processor model which executes programs written
in a simple assembly. The processor is designed to be easily extensible and used
as an SST example element/component.

The SST project team use Juno to perform some simple (but fast) correctness checks
of the SST memory hierarchy, network-on-chip and memory sub-system modeling.
